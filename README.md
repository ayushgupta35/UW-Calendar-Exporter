### Say Goodbye to Manual Calendar Entry! üìÖ

Tired of manually entering each class's details into your calendar every time you register? With **UW Calendar Exporter**, you can easily export each of your University of Washington courses from your registration page to Google or Apple Calendar. No more worrying about adding locations, days, times, or repeat schedules! Just click a button for each class, and let the extension handle the rest.

Instead of manually entering every class, this tool allows you to add only the courses you want to your calendar. Each button click generates a Google Calendar event or downloads an ICS file, which automatically fills in details like course name, professor, location, class times, and weekly recurrence until the end of the quarter.

### Features ‚ú®

- **Dynamic Quarter Dates**: Automatically scrapes current quarter start/end dates from the official UW Academic Calendar
- **Per-Class Export**: Choose which classes to add to your calendar with an easy button for each one
- **Automatic Event Details**: The extension populates course name, professor, location, time, and recurrence until the end of the quarter
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Opens a Google Calendar event page with all details filled in, ready for you to save
- **Apple Calendar Compatibility**: Downloads an ICS file that you can open to add the event directly to Apple Calendar
- **User-Friendly**: Seamless interface accessible directly on the University of Washington's registration page
- **Tested & Reliable**: Comprehensive test suite ensures accurate date parsing and calendar generation
